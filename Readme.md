 Smart Home Automation via Voice Control | IoT + Arduino Cloud

A smart home automation system developed using **ESP32** and **Arduino IoT Cloud**, enabling remote and voice-based control of home appliances like fans and lights via Google Assistant.

 Features
 Control 2 fans and 2 lights via Arduino Cloud Dashboard
 Google Assistant voice integration through IFTTT
 Real-time device status monitoring
 Modular code for easy scalability
 Wi-Fi-based ESP32 control system

 Technologies Used
 **ESP32 Microcontroller**
 **Arduino IoT Cloud**
 **IFTTT (Google Assistant Trigger)**
 **Adafruit IO (optional dashboard)**
 **Proteus/Serial Monitor for testing**

 Files Included
 `main_controller.ino`: Handles initialization, loop, and Cloud connection
 `handlers.ino`: Event functions for fan/light state changes
 `thingProperties.h`: Auto-generated by Arduino Cloud


 Setup Instructions
1. Open all `.ino` files in the Arduino IDE.
2. Configure your `thingProperties.h` file with:
   - `DEVICE_LOGIN_NAME`
   - `SSID`, `PASS`
   - `SECRET_DEVICE_KEY`
3. Use Arduino Cloud to sync the thing properties.
4. Deploy to ESP32.
5. Link Google Assistant via IFTTT to your cloud variables.
